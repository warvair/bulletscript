BulletScript is an bytecode-compiled language, written in C++, used for designing bullet patterns in shmup-style games.  It is however, generic enough that it can be used for other purposes (particle systems, shmup beam weapons, mob behaviour, etc).  It is licensed under the MIT license (X11).

Both the source and SDK can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/bulletscript/downloads/list

You can get a feel for the language by looking at some scripts here: http://code.google.com/p/bulletscript/source/browse/trunk/examples/testbed/bin/General.script

(None!)

I'm looking for someone to make a linux build!  The code does actually compile on linux, but I'm having problems with getting make set up to build the shared objects in the proper way.
