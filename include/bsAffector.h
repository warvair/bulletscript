	/**	\brief Affector class for manipulating emitted objects.
	 *
	 *	Affectors are C++ functions supplied by the user which are applied to objects
	 *	at each update.  Affectors differ from script functions in that the function
	 *	is run on the object in full at each update, whereas script functions are applied
	 *	once over the course of the object's lifetime.  Furthermore, affectors can take
	 *	arguments which can change over time, whereas a script function's arguments cannot
	 *	be changed once the function is called.  The other use of affectors is performance-
	 *	critical code, where doing things in script simply isn't fast enough and native C++
	 *	is needed.
	 *	The Affector class is an instance of a particular affector function, holding its
	 *	particular arguments.  The function itself is a function pointer defined by AffectorFunction.
	 *	Due to speed reasons, Affectors have a hard limit on the number of arguments that they can
	 *	take.  This is defined by BS_MAX_AFFECTOR_ARGS in bsConfig.h.
