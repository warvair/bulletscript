// of view of a language, but given the typical usage of the language, are unlikely to be an issue.
// These values can also be decreased if memory is more important: for instance, the default value of
// BS_MAX_AFFECTOR_ARGS is quite generous, and if you are using 8 arguments in an affector, then there
// is likely a more efficient way of achieving the effect you want.
