<h1>Getting started</h1>
In order to best get the feel of BulletScript, it's probably worth starting off by looking at various example scripts.  BulletScript is somewhat esoteric
so the scripts may not make obvious sense at a high level, but the basic syntax is pretty regular and should be straightforward to people used to
programming.  After that, either read the <a href="BulletScript.html">language reference</a> or start with this guide, whichever you are more comfortable 
with.  The guide and the reference rely on each other to an extent, in order to not duplicate information.

BulletScript emits and (optionally) controls objects.  These objects can be more or less anything, although some things lend themselves better to it than
others.  Particles, shapes, bullets, even sound effects are all good candidates.  In order to use BulletScript, the user must create a system which can
interface with it.  For each system, a core "type" is declared, and then the uers sets BulletScript to interface with this type's system by specifying
function callbacks.  The implementation of these callbacks is entirely up to the user, although there will in practice be a general pattern to them.  This
is discussed in the tutorial section.<p>
Once user systems have been bound to BulletScript, and scripts written and compiled, the user must create some BulletScript objects in order to do any work.
These two objects are <i>emitter</i> and <i>controller</i> and are explained in the next section.  These objects are then updated once a frame, or at
whatever interval the user wants.

Everything in the language is built around making emission and subsequent control as flexible and powerful as possible.  An <i>emitter</i> is the core object that performs these tasks.  Emitters contain
at least one <i>state</i>.  A state is essentially a function which takes no arguments, and which loops back to the beginning once it is complete, rather
than returning.  An emitter always has a current state, and when updated, it executes the code until either it changes state or it is told to suspend
execution.  A simple state might look like this:
<pre>
	Main = state
	{
		emit bullet();
		wait(1);
	}
</pre>
This state will emit a bullet every second, until either the emitter is destroyed, or a controller changes its state (this is discussed later).  The
script suspends execution for a second after every emission.  Note that if the wait statement were not that, execution would never stop and the virtual
machine would most likely crash or enter an infinite loop.  States can be switched between using the <span class="code">goto</span> statement.  This
changes state and immediately starts executing it.
<pre>
	Stage1 = state
	{
		emit bullet(180);
		goto Stage2;
	}

	Stage2 = state
	{
		emit bullet(135);
		goto Stage1;
	}
</pre>
One can use the control structures defined in the <a href="BulletScript.html">language reference</a> to make things more complex:
<pre>
	Stage1 = state
	{
		// emit bullet at angle 0
		emit bullet(0);
		goto Stage2;
	}

	Stage2 = state
	{
		// declare and set local variable
		i = 0;

		// emit 10 bullets, spaced evenly from 0 to 180 degrees, with an increasing delay between each one
		while (i < 10)
		{
			emit bullet(i * 20);
			wait(i / 10);
			i++;
		}

		// 30% chance that we change state at this point
		if (rand(10) < 3)
		{
	
			goto Stage1;
		}
	}
</pre>

Emitters can also have special functions, which are declared inline.  These are used to control the behaviour of emitted objects.
<pre>
	Explode = function(time)
	{
		// tell the object to suspend script execution for <i>time</i> seconds.
		wait(time);

		// emit 10 'explosion particles'
		i = 0;
		while (i < 10)
		{
			emit bullet(i * 40);
			i++;
		}

		// and tell the object to kill itself.
		die;

		// at this point, do not do anything which requires the object!  It is alright to set locals, member variables, etc,
		// but pretty much anything else will probably cause a crash.
	}

	Stage1 = state
	{
		// emit a bullet, telling it to use the Explode function.  Thus, any bullets emitted by this line will die after 5 seconds.
		emit bullet() : Explode(5);
		wait(1);
	}
</pre>
An emitted object can have at most one function.  Emitter functions have a normal control flow: when they reach the end of their statement list, they
return, and do not loop back like states do.  It is important to note that when a function ends, the emitted object that it is controlling does not get
killed.  The only way to kill an object from script is explicitly via the <span class="code">die</span> statement in a function.
