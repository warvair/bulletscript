<h1>BulletScript language reference</h1>

BulletScript uses two fundamental objects: <span class="code">controller</span> and <span class="code">emitter</span>.  Both are simple state
machines, but they differ slightly in how they can be controlled, and what they control themselves.  Emitters are responsible for actually creating
objects, and for controlling the behaviour of those objects afterwards.  Controllers are used to group and control emitters, synchronising them.

<h2>Emitters</h2>

Emitters are defined in the following form:<p>
<pre>
emitter <i>emitter_name</i>
{
	[member_variable_list]
	[affector_instance_list]
	[function_list]
	state_list
}
</pre>

Member variables
