<h1>BulletScript language reference</h1>

BulletScript is a pseudo-object oriented language.  It has a basic concept of classes, but does not use a lot of the functionality found in OO languages
such as Java, C++, etc.  It has two class types, three basic variable types, and two more slightly different variable types.  The first section gives a
general overview of the language features, and the second explains how and where they should be used.<p>

<a name="lang"><h1>Language features</h1></a>
<h3>Data types</h3>
BulletScript has one data type.  As such it is an untyped language.  By default, the data type is a 32-bit float, although this can be changed (but it is
not recommended that this is done!) by modifying the relevant <span class="code">#define</span> in bsConfig.h.  For the default floating point data
type, literal values are expressed as:
<pre>
	1
	1.
	1.2345
	.2345
</pre>	
As long as the number contains at most one decimal point, and only numeric characters, it is valid.

<h3>Expressions</h3>
Expressions consist of literal values, variables and function calls, combined together with operators.  
Some example expressions:
<pre>
	5
	12 + var
	rand(360) + (x / 2) > 100
	foo(bar(z, 12))
</pre>

BulletScript uses the following operators.  Operators cannot be overloaded by users.
<pre>	+ - * / % > < >= <= == != && ||</pre>
Notes: 
<list>
<li>Despite using floating point, the modulus (<span class="code">%</span>) operator can be used.  However it will convert the values to integers before 
calculation.  BulletScript does not currently support fractional modulus calculation.</li>
<li>The equivalence operators (<span class="code">> < >= <= == !=</span>) and the logical operators (<span class="code">&& ||</span>) return 1 if the 
condition is true, and 0 if false.
</list>
<p>

<h3>Comments</h3>
BulletScript uses standard comments: <span class="code">//</span> for single line comments and <span class="code">/* */</span> to enclose multiple-line ones.
<pre>
	// single line comment
	/* multiple
	   line
	   comment
	*/
</pre>

<h3>Variables</h3>
Like other OO languages, BulletScript has local, member and global variables.  Local variables only exist within the scope of the declaring
<span class="code">state</span>, <span class="code">function</span> or <span class="code">event</span>.  They do not need special syntax for declaration
and are declared as soon as they are used for the first time on the left hand side of an expression.  Member variables exist within the scope
of the class which declares them, and global variables are accessible from anywhere within the system.  Global variables may only be declared from
code, and not script, and unlike locals and members may be declared constant, and hence read-only to the script.  Variables are assigned expressions
like so:
<pre>
	x = 5;
</pre>
There are also other assignment operators:  <span class="code">+= -= *= /= ++ --</span><br>
These are statements and not expressions.
<pre>
	x += 5; 	// ok (x = x + 5)
	x++;		// ok (x = x + 1)
	x = y += 5; 	// error
</pre>

Note: the <span class="code">++ --</span> operators are <i>post-increment</i> only.

<h3>Functions</h3>
There are actually two types of functions: emitters have their own special type to control emitted objects, and there are more classical functions which can
be used in expressions.  Emitter functions will be discussed later.  'Expression' functions are used as follows:
<pre>
	<i>function_name</i>(<i>expression_list</i>);
	<i>value</i> = <i>function_name</i>(<i>expression_list</i>);
</pre>

For instance:
<pre>
	ret = get_value();
	r = rand(360 * time);
</pre>

Functions may return a single value, or nothing, and take a list of comma-separated expressions as arguments.  They can only be defined in native code, 
and then exposed to BulletScript, they cannot be defined within the script itself.

<h3>Conditional statements</h3>
Conditional statements take the form of an if-else chain.
<pre>
	if (<i>expression_statement</i>)
	{
		<i>statement_list</i>
	}
	else if(<i>expression_statement</i>)
	{
		<i>statement_list</i>
	}
	else
	{
		<i>statement_list</i>
	}
</pre>
Enclosing braces must be used for every block of code, even if it only has one line.

<h3>Iteration statements</h3>
Iteration is achieved with <span class="code">while</span>:
<pre>
	while(<i>expression_statement</i>)
	{
		<i>statement_list</i>
	}
</pre>
The list statements is executed as long as the expression evalulates to non-zero.  Example:
<pre>
	i = 0;
	while(i < 10)
	{
		// do something

		i++;
	}
</pre>

There are two special keywords for iteration statements which control its flow: <span class="code">break</span> and <span class="code">continue</span>.
<span class="code">break</span> immediately jumps out of the loop and carries on straight after the closing brace.  <span class="code">continue</span>
jumps forward to the start of the next iteration of the loop.

<h3>Wait statements</h3>
Wait statements are used to stop processing the script and leave it for a certain period of time.
<pre>
	wait(<i>expression_statement</i>);
</pre>
This waits for the specified number of seconds.  If the value is less than or equal to zero, it has no effect.

<h3>Emit statements</h3>
Emit statements are the heart of BulletScript.  They may only be used by emitters, and are discussed below.

<h3>Die statements</h3>
Die statements are ontologically the opposite of emit.  They may only be used by emitters, and are discussed below.

<a name="classes"><h1>Class types</h1></a>
BulletScript uses two classes: <span class="code">controller</span> and <span class="code">emitter</span>.  Both are simple state
machines, but they differ slightly in how they can be controlled, and what they control themselves.  Emitters are responsible for actually creating
objects, and for controlling the behaviour of those objects afterwards.  Controllers are used to group and control emitters, synchronising them.

<h2>Emitters</h2>

Emitters are defined in the following form:<p>
<pre>
	emitter <i>emitter_name</i>
	{
		<i>member_variable_list</i>
		<i>affector_instance_list</i>
		<i>function_list</i>
		<i>state_list</i>
	}
</pre>

Member variables are declared as follows:<p>
<pre>
	<i>var_name</i> = expression;
</pre>
The expression must be evaluable at that point in the code.  That is, it cannot use member variables that have not been declared yet, or any functions
or global variables that have not been bound to the system by the user.  It is important to note at this point that there are two different types of function
in BulletScript.  This will be explained later.
<p>
Affector instances are declared as follows:<p>
<pre>
	<i>var_name</i> = affector <i>affector_function</i>(expression_list);
</pre>
The <span class="code">affector_function</span> is the name of the affector function pointer which has been bound using 
<span class="code">Machine::registerAffector</span> in C++.  <span class="code">expression_list</span> is a comma-separated list of expressions.  It is
important to note that member variables cannot be used for affector arguments.  They may be within lexical scope, but consider how affectors work: they
are applied at each update to any emitted objects, and they need to resolve their arguments.  If an emitter is destroyed, any objects that it has emitted
which are still active will not be able to resolve the arguments that use a member variable of that emitter.
<p>
The second type of functions (mentioned earlier) are emitter functions.  These are blocks of code used to control the behaviour of objects emitted by
the emitter.  A function definition looks like this:
<pre>
	<i>func_name</i> = function(argument_list)
	{
		<i>statement_list</i>
	}
</pre>
Here, <span class="code">argument_list</span> is a comma-separated list of argument names, matching values that the function requires to be passed in.  There
are several special statements which can be used in emitter functions.  First are the aforementioned <span class="code">emit</span> and
<span class="code">die</span> statements.

<h3>Emit statements</h3>
These take the form:
<pre>
	<i>emit_func emit_type</i> (<i>expression_list</i>) [: <i>controller_list</i>];
</pre>

Here, <span class="code">emit_func</span> is the named emission function specified in code by <span class="code">Machine::registerEmitFunction</span>.  <span class="code">emit_type</span> is the named type created by <span class="code">Machine::createType</span>.The <span class="code">controller_list</span> specifies how the emitted object will be controlled after emission.  It is a comma-separated list of any of the following:
<list>
<li>At most one emitter function.
<li>Affector instances.
<li>Anchors
</list>
<p>
Emitter functions and affector instances are discussed above, but anchors have not.  Anchors are used to connect certain properties of an Emitter to any objects created by it.  For instance, they can be used to attach a laser beam to the Emitter, so that it does not float off into space when the Emitter moves.  Anchors are prefaced with <span class="code">&</span>.  The pre-defined anchors are:
<pre>	&x &y &z &angle &orbit &kill</pre>
<span class="code">x</span>, <span class="code">y</span> (and <span class="code">z</span> if enabled) are the Emitter position, <span class="code">angle</span> is the Emitter angle.  <span class="code">orbit</span> makes the object rotate around the Emitter at whatever distance it is from it, based on the Emitter's angle.  <span class="code">kill</span> is a special anchor which tells the Emitter to destroy the object when it itself is
killed (the default behaviour is for it to de-anchor it).
<p>
Example emission statements:
<pre>
	grav = affector Gravity(9.81);
	force = affector Forcefield();

	control = function(x)
	{
	}

	emitAngle bullet(180);
	emitAngle bullet(180) : grav, control(10);
	emitAngle bullet(180) : control(10), $x, $y, force, grav;
	emitAngle bullet(180) : control(10), $x, $y, &kill;
</pre>
<h3>Die statements</h3>
<span class="code">die</span> is used in an emitter function to destroy the object that it controls.  The syntax is simply:
<pre>
	die;
</pre>
Any code which follows this statement in a function may cause undefined effects, most likely crashing the system if it accesses the object which has just been destroyed.

<h2>Controllers</h2>

Controllers are used to control one or more Emitter.  They can change their position, angle, member variables (technically, position and angle are member variables), enable or disable them, or force them to wait indefinitely ("suspend").  Controllers are defined in the following form:<p>
<pre>
	controller <i>controller_name</i>
	{
		<i>member_variable_list</i>
		<i>emitter_list</i>
		<i>event_list</i>
		<i>state_list</i>
	}
</pre>

Member variables are defined in the same way as Emitter member variables, and are subject to the same restrictions for initialisation.
<p>
Emitter variables are instances of named Emitters which are to be controlled.  Their declaration is as follows:
<pre>
	<i>emitter_var</i> = emitter <i>emit_type</i>;
	<i>emitter_var</i> = emitter <i>emit_type</i>(<i>constant_list</i>);
</pre>

The second declaration allows for setting the Emitter's member variables on creation.  The values here must be constants, not expressions involving functions or variables.  This is a efficiency consideration.  The only variables that are set are the built-in members: <span class="code">x</span>, <span class="code">y</span>, (<span class="code">z</span>), and <span class="code">angle</span>.  Any extra values are ignored.  Examples:
<pre>
	emitter1 = emitter Blaster;
	emitter2 = emitter Blaster(0, 10, 0); // x offset = 0, y offset = 0, angle offset = 0
	emitter3 = emitter Laser(1, 2, 3, 4); // value '4' is ignored 
	emitter4 = emitter Laser(5 + rand()); // error, not constant
</pre>
