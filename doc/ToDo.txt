initial x/y/angle should be specified when new'ing a gun

affector arguments may change: do we have it so that already emitted bullets use the old arguments, or
the current ones?

Member variables may need to have listeners like global variables.

have the possibility of bullets taking a script behaviour function

scriptmachine needs an error log.

how can we have bullets emitting bullets? also areas: for instance we could do forked lightning with
area-emitters, also beams that change direction, bullet fireworks, etc.

Remove containers where possible

	BulletGun::mAffectors
	BulletMachine::mBulletAffectors
	GlobalVariable::mListeners
	
	simple memory allocator
