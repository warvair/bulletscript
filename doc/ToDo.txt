	Changing angle needs to specify direction, and handle warping from 0 to 360 properly.
	
	Look into better ways of representing a pure circle.  Adaptive points?  To do this, use a std::list of
	points, and then insert/remove points inbetween existing ones?
	Circles also do not need to be rotated if they are not scaled.
