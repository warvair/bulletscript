Fire functions need to allow the individual gun to chose how to emit, because they may use
different batteries, for instance.  Therefore, fire functions need a user param, which is
to do with the emitting gun, and can be called.  
Or this could even be a function pointer: fire() passes in a BulletGunBase

Profile memory usage:
	Create console app, no rendering.  Create about 30 ships, give each 2 random emitters (just
	bullets, do area separately).

Remove containers where possible
	BulletAffector::mArguments
	BulletGun::mAffectors
	BulletMachine::mBulletAffectors
	GlobalVariable::mListeners

Homing affector

Per-state affectors
