What to do when user wants to manually control bullets from code?  Ie, when you fire a weapon,
the bullets stop their current behaviour and get sucked towards/blown away from you, and then
maybe resume their old behaviour when you stop firing.  This is an edge case but it must be considered.

avoid float-int conversions where possible

affector arguments may change: do we have it so that already emitted bullets use the old arguments, or
the current ones?

Remove containers where possible
	BulletAffector::mArguments
	BulletGun::mAffectors
	BulletMachine::mBulletAffectors
	GlobalVariable::mListeners
	
	simple memory allocator?

Homing affector

Per-state affectors
